# Australian Health Star Rating Calculator
The Australian Health Star Rating system is a government initiative to label foods with 0.5 to 5 stars to indicate how healthy they are. The calculation is very convoluted so I created a webpage to calculate it. Needs a bit of polish to look nice but it works.
